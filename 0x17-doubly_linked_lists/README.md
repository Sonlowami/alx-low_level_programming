# 0X17.C - Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is a data structure in C whose nodes contain a reference to
a node that precedes it and one that succeeds it.
It is superior to a singly linked list in that a program can traverse a doubly-linked list
in both the forward and the reverse direction, while a singly-linked list only traverses
in the forward direction.
This directory contain programs that use doubly-linked lists to solve programming challenges.
The docstring of each function clearly tells what the function does.
